# scheduler
Scheduling things.

Born out of necessity because UConn's Schedule Builder died.

## Usage
* define your own classes in `scheduler.py`
* run `python3 scheduler.py` to build and show all possible schedules
* pipe into file for viewing convenience: `python3 scheduler.py > schedule.txt`

## Hackable
Do whatever the fuck you want.
* Add lunch and a no-8am block as a class
* Use an API so you don't have to manually define classes
* Add a nice GUI
* Add additional info to classes (location, professor, section)
